# Ticket System Workflow

This project uses a ticket-based development workflow. All tickets are stored as markdown files organized by EPIC.

## Ticket System Overview

- **Location**: `tasks/` (pending tickets) and `tasks/done/` (completed tickets)
- **Organization**: Tickets are organized by EPIC folders (EPIC-00 through EPIC-13) in both tasks and tasks/done
- **PRD Reference**: Product requirements are documented in `tasks/PRD.md`
- **Ticket Format**: Each ticket is a markdown file with structured sections

## Ticket Workflow Rules

### Execution Order
- Work tickets in order within each EPIC (TICK-0001 before TICK-0002, etc.)
- Always check dependencies listed in each ticket file before starting
- Respect the dependency chain - don't start a ticket until its dependencies are complete

### Branching Strategy
- **One ticket = one branch = one merge to main**
- Branch naming convention: `ticket/<TICKET_ID>-<short-slug>`
  - Example: `ticket/TICK-0102-noise2d-fbm`
- Keep diffs small and reversible
- Do not refactor unrelated code in a ticket branch

### Definition of Done

Every ticket must meet these criteria before being marked complete:

1. **Compilation**: Project compiles for visionOS and runs in immersive mode
2. **Proof**: There is visible or logged proof the feature works
3. **Integration**: Feature is integrated (not a detached demo) unless explicitly stated otherwise
4. **No TODOs**: No TODOs in the main code path (allowed only behind debug flags)
5. **Testing**: Complete the manual test plan specified in the ticket

## Ticket File Structure

Each ticket markdown file contains these sections:

- **Why**: Rationale for the ticket
- **Goal**: What success looks like
- **Steps**: Implementation steps
- **Files to Create**: New files to add
- **Files to Modify**: Existing files to change
- **Deliverables**: What will be delivered
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Checklist of requirements
- **Manual Test Plan**: Steps to verify the feature
- **Out of Scope**: What this ticket explicitly does not include
- **Rollback Plan**: How to revert if needed

**Always read the full ticket file before starting work.**

## Moving Tickets

When a ticket is complete:

1. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
2. Complete the manual test plan
3. Move the ticket file from `tasks/EPIC-XX/` to `tasks/DONE/EPIC-XX/` (keep the EPIC folder structure)
4. Merge the branch to main
5. Delete the ticket branch

## Working with Tickets

- Before starting: Read the entire ticket file, check dependencies, understand the goal
- During work: Follow the steps, create/modify files as specified, keep changes focused
- Before completion: Verify acceptance criteria, run manual tests, ensure no regressions
- After completion: Move ticket to DONE, clean up any temporary debug code
